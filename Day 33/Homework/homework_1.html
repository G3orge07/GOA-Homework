        <p class="gen-info">David IV, also known as David IV the Builder(1073–1125), of the Bagrationi dynasty, was the 5th king of the Kingdom of Georgia from 1089 until his death in 1125.
         Popularly considered to be the greatest and most successful Georgian ruler in history and an original architect of the Georgian Golden Age, he succeeded in driving the Seljuk Turks out of the country, 
         winning the Battle of Didgori in 1121. His reforms of the army and administration enabled him to reunite the country and bring most of the lands of the Caucasus under Georgia's control.
         A friend of the Church and a notable promoter of Christian culture, he was canonized by the Georgian Orthodox Church.

            <h3 id="section2" class="family-background">Family background and early life</h3>
        <p id="family--background" class="family-background">The year of David's birth can be calculated from the date of his accession to the throne recorded in the Life of King of Kings David written c. 1123–1126. Thus, he would have been born 
            in k'oronikon 293 or 294, that is, c. 1073. According to the same source, he died in k'oronikon 345, when he would have been in his 52nd or 53rd year. Professor Cyril Toumanoff gives 1070 
            and 24 January 1125 as the dates for David.<br> According to the Life of King of Kings David, written c. 1123–1126, David was the only son of King George II of Georgia The contemporaneous
             Armenian chronicler Matthew of Edessa mentions David's brother Totorme.The latter, according to the modern historian Robert W. Thomson, was his sister.The name of David's mother, 
             Elene, is recorded in a margin note in the Gospel of Matthew from the Tskarostavi monastery; she is otherwise unattested.David bore the name of the biblical king-prophet, whose 78th 
             descendant he was claimed to be.</p>

            <p>David grew up in times of war and desolation, due to the ravages of the Seljuks and his father's numerous defeats against these invaders. Faced with such a situation, significant opposition
                 arose against King George II and led to a change of power for the benefit of young David; George of Chqondidi would have been one of these opponents.</p>
            <p>The Life of King of Kings David does not recount the details of the transfer of power between George II and his son. Nodar Asatiani describes the event as a “palace revolution” involving several 
                dignitaries in 1089.[20] Other historians speak rather of pressure on the Georgian king with a view to his abdication instead of a coup d'état.[21] The contemporary chronicler of David IV limits himself to 
                mentioning the change of power as a coronation of the young prince by his father,[22] which pushes certain historians like Cyril Toumanoff to suggest a co-reign between George II and David IV, at least until 1112,[23] while frescoes found
                 in the Ateni Sioni Church represent him in monk's clothing, which would mean that his abdication was forced.[24] The historical tradition founded by Prince Vakhushti in the 18th century and followed by Marie-Félicité Brosset in the 19th 
                 states that David succeeded George upon his death, a number of surviving documents suggest that George died around 1112, and that although he retained the royal title until his death,[25][26][22] he played no significant political role,
                  real power having passed on to David.[26] Moreover, David himself had been a co-ruler with his father sometime before his becoming a king-regant in 1089; a document of 1085 mentions David as "king and sebastos", the latter being a Byzantine
